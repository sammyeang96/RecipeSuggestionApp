  <p>
    We are RecAPI and our app will allow users to login and keep track of their virtual cabinet representing their ingredients. 
    These ingredients will be used to determine what recipes can be created. It will allow users to search for recipes 
    with certain ingredients, create their own recipes, and will also make recommendations based on the user's pantry.
