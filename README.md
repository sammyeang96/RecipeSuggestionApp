# RecipeSuggestionApp
Revature Project 2
Team recAPI's: Dylan Corbus, Mike Davis, Joel DeVos, Sammy Eang, Tiffany

The app we are designing will suggest to the user recipes based on the ingredients they already own. Users will be able to add ingredients to their virtual pantry and get recipe suggestions based on what ingredients they own, in order of which recipes they can most readily make.

Making an account will allow users to save/update their pantry for ease of recipe access. There is also a basic search functionality for any recipes the user wants to find or make regardless.
